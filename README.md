# Projects Repository

As the name suggests, this repository serves as an ePortfolio showcasing the: Statistics, Data, machine learning, AI and Quantum projects I have undertaken during my studies.

This e-portfolio is organized by year. This means that the closer you get to graduation, the more advanced the projects are.
