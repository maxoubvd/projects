# Ammonia Molecule

This project is a study about the Ammonia molecule in a Finite Double Well. This project highlights key concept of Quantum physics like degeneracy and tunneling but also conclude about the consequences of the Tunnel Effect.

# QML with Merlin

This project is an initiation to Machine Learning using quantum layers using the famous Iris Classification dataset.
I did this little notebook following a webinar from **Quandela** and the documentation of **Merlin**.
